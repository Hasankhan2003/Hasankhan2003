## Hi 👋, I'm Ahmad Hasan Khan  

I’m a **Data Scientist** with a strong passion for **problem solving and building practical AI solutions**. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, exploring data deeply, and designing intelligent systems that translate theory into real-world impact.

My core interests revolve around **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing**, with a growing focus on **LLMs and production-ready AI systems**. I thrive on learning new tools, experimenting with modern AI frameworks, and continuously improving how models are designed, trained, and deployed.

I am especially driven by:
- Solving **real-world problems** using data-driven approaches  
- Building **end-to-end ML & AI pipelines**  
- Working with **LLMs, embeddings, and intelligent retrieval systems**  
- Writing clean, scalable, and efficient code  

I believe strong engineering starts with **clear thinking, strong fundamentals, and curiosity**, and I aim to grow as an AI professional who builds solutions that actually work.
