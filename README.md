# Hi! I'm Ahmad Hasan Khan

I’m a student and a **Data/AI enthusiast** currently in that "figuring it out" phase—but with a lot of curiosity. I don't just stick to one thing; I’m exploring how everything from **Data Engineering** to **AI/ML** fits together to build something that actually works.

I love the whole process: from the "boring" part of cleaning messy data to the cool part where a model starts making sense.

### 🛠️ What I’m into right now:

* **Data Engineering:** Learning how to build the "plumbing" and systems that keep data moving.
* **AI & ML Engineering:** Playing around with **PyTorch** and **LLMs** to see what I can build beyond just tutorials.
* **Analytics:** Using **SQL** and **Power BI** to find the actual stories hidden in numbers.

I’m not an expert yet, but I’m consistently learning to bridge the gap between **Engineering** and **Intelligence** to build end-to-end solutions.
