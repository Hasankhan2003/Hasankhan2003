## Hi 👋, I'm Ahmad Hasan Khan  

I’m a **Data Scientist** who enjoys solving problems by turning raw data into **clear insights and intelligent solutions**. I like working across the full data lifecycle — from understanding business questions and exploring data, to building analytical dashboards and AI-driven systems.

My interests span **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and NLP**, where I focus on extracting meaning from data and designing models and pipelines that are both **practical and scalable**. I believe strong problem-solving starts with asking the right questions, validating assumptions, and choosing the right tools for the task.

I’m particularly driven by:
- **Analytical problem solving** using data-driven reasoning  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & visualization** to uncover patterns and trends  
- Building **ML & AI systems** that extend beyond notebooks  
- Working with **LLMs and modern AI tools** to solve real-world challenges  

I enjoy continuous learning and aim to grow as a professional who can bridge **analytics, engineering, and AI** effectively.
