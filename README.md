## Hi , I'm Ahmad Hasan Khan

I’m a **data enthusiast and aspiring Data/AI Engineer** who loves turning messy data into meaningful insights and smart solutions. As a student exploring the world of **Data Engineering, AI Engineering, and Analytics**, I enjoy working across the entire data journey — from collecting and cleaning data to building dashboards, models, and intelligent systems.

I’m curious about how data flows, how models think, and how insights drive decisions. Whether it’s designing data pipelines, exploring patterns through visualization, or experimenting with ML and LLMs, I enjoy building things that are both **practical and impactful**.

What I do:

* Finding patterns through **EDA and data visualization**
* Building **data pipelines and scalable systems**
* Creating ML & AI solutions that solve real problems
* Exploring **LLMs and modern AI tools**

I believe good data work starts with asking the right questions and choosing the right tools — and I’m constantly learning to sharpen both.

Currently growing into a professional who can confidently connect **analytics, engineering, and AI** to build end-to-end solutions.
